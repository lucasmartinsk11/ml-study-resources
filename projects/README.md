- **Production Pipelines**: End-to-end ML systems

## Project Structure
Each project should include:
```
project_name/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Project description and results
â”œâ”€â”€ data/              # Dataset (if small) or data loading scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/         # Exploratory analysis and experiments
â”œâ”€â”€ src/               # Source code and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ models/            # Trained model artifacts
â”œâ”€â”€ results/           # Outputs, plots, and reports
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt   # Dependencies
```

## Guidelines
